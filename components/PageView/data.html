<h2>Family support intervention </h2>
<p>HOME | Created by JLOUIS on Tue Mar 07 2017 15:37:08 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time) </p>
<p>
<p>The referral made to Eat, Sleep, Learn and Play was approved and the family was offered a Gas
  Cooker which will be delivered on the 10/03/17.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I informed Ms Bonsu that the case will be closing to the unit and we believe that she has been
  doing very well, both as a mother and managing her health. &nbsp;I explained to Ms Bonsu how the
  intervention with her has worked well. I also informed Ms B that before the case close I will
  contact the health professionals and her family network for feedback about their support to her.
  &nbsp;Ms B said that it is fine by her for the case to be closed; Ms B said that she was please
  with the support she received &nbsp;and happy to hear someone telling her how well she had done
  .&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The children</strong></p>

<p>During the time of visiting the family, they were having dinner. &nbsp;Ms B complained about one
  of the twins who is not eating his food and she has to force him to eat, she referred to the other
  twin eating well. &nbsp;i advised her that most times, twins are different may not have the same
  liking but if she is concern that she should take him to the GP for a check up. &nbsp;I observed
  the others eating well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<p>I made a home visit to see how the family settled in their new home. &nbsp;All the children were
  seen and appeared relaxed and happy to be in a bigger environment. When I asked them about the new
  home they said that they like it. &nbsp;All the furniture and home equipment&nbsp;were
  all&nbsp;in&nbsp;boxes and cupboard. &nbsp;However, the kitchen appliances and other kitchenware
  were all in place. &nbsp;Ms Bonsu informed me that she has not had any gas therefore she cooks
  rice in the rice cooker and neither has any heating. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Bonsu was of the opinion that she had contacted her gas and electric suppliers to connect her.
  &nbsp;I supported her in making a call to the Housing association about the gas. &nbsp;It turned
  out that she had to contact her suppliers again before the gas could be uncapped, suppliers were
  contacted and to the housing association and she was informed that someone would call in tomorrow.
  I informed the receptionist that there were young children to see if that would speed up the
  process but was asked to wait until tomorrow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I left the family&#39;s home and advised that they keep warm, I &nbsp;&nbsp;that Ms Bonsu keep
  the younger ones very warm. &nbsp;</p>

  with the process. We discussed the things that she will need to move to the new home, the
  following are needed: fridge, cooker, 2 double mattress, microwave, net&nbsp;and heavy
  curtains.&nbsp; I informed Ms B that I will make an application for the white goods and the unit
  with also give some financial support as agreed by the manager.<br />
  Ms B said that Mr Frimpong will be coming to help her transport some small items to the flat but
  she will be getting a van for the larger items.</p>

<p>I informed Ms B that I will arrange for a professionals meeting and explained the purpose of
  it.&nbsp; Ms B informed me that she had discussion with Parveen from Perinatal who will be closing
  her can and transfer her to Anita House.&nbsp; I echoed how well she is doing and professionals

<p>All the children were seen, appeared contented and relax getting reading for their new

<h2>Family support intervention - plan review</h2>
<p>HOME | Created by JLOUIS on Mon Oct 24 2016 11:15:40 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time) </p>
<p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 21/10/16/<strong>Time: </strong>4pm/<strong>Duration: </strong>1 hour</p>

<p><strong>Present: </strong>Ms Bonsu, Mr Aduesi and all the children</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of visit: </strong>to review the plan</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>

<p>We went through the plan, I explained each goal to them and how it has been met.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Housing:</em></strong> supported letter and accompany to Shelter.&nbsp; Ms Bonsu also
  informed me of the good news, she has been invited to view 2 properties on the 01/11/16; a 3 and 4
  bedroom properties.&nbsp; She is very happy about it and hoping that she would get the 4 bedroom
  property.</p>

<p><strong><em>Engagement with health professionals</em></strong>: I informed Ms Bonsu that I have
  been in contact with Emma Yates her mental health midwife and she told me that there were no
  concerns with her mental health.&nbsp; She said that she saw her psychiatrist Tara Long and said
  that everything was ok, Mr Adusei confirmed that also. Ms Bonsu further informed me that she had
  her 6 weeks check on the 21/10/16, both mother and baby are doing well. &nbsp;However, Ms Bonsu
  said that her GP told her the blood pressure was high and had given her some tablets and advised
  that she get it check again in 2 weeks&rsquo; time.&nbsp; I advised Ms B to make sure that she
  takes her medicine regular. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Family network support: </em></strong>parents said that everything is going well with
  them, but Ms B said that her mother is not able to travel at the moment because she is not too
  well.</p>

<p><strong><em>Baby: </em></strong>The baby Red Book was seen and baby is thriving well weighed
  4.6kg and had her 6 weeks check.</p>

<p><strong><em>Activities for the boys: </em></strong>I told the boys that I will take them out one
  day next week and asked that they think of somewhere of interest that they would like to go or I
  might choose somewhere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Views of the carer/parents</strong></p>

<p>Both parents are happy that the plan is going on well and has no concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Views of child/ren</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Observation</strong> (presentation, interaction between carers/parents and the child/ren,
  home condition, etc)</p>

<p>On arrival at the home address, the family were all seen sitting at the table having their
  dinner. There was hardly any conversation during that time but appeared to enjoying their
  food.&nbsp; Mr Adusei was seen attending to baby Afua.&nbsp; After dinner they all helped to clear
  up and went to the bedroom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>

<p>The visit went well. The family plan was reviewed and so far it&rsquo;s working well for the
  family.&nbsp; The family also have good news about housing to view properties in the next 2
  weeks.&nbsp; I talked to Mr Adusei and Ms Bonsu about taking the boys out for some activity one
  day for the half term.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Progress with Family Plan:</strong></p>

<p>The plan is working according to plan, most of the goals are met.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Action:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Half term activity for the boys.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Family Support home visit</h2>
<p>HOME | Created by JLOUIS on Mon Sep 19 2016 12:17:02 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time) </p>
<p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: 14/09/16</p>

<p><strong>Present</strong>: Ms Bonsu, Mr Adusei, and the children</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of visit</strong>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p>

<p>I asked how she been since coming out of hospital, she said that she is feeling well and has no
  problems.&nbsp; A home visit was made by the midwife earlier today, who&nbsp; informed that the
  baby has a little bit of jaundice, Ms Bonsu said that she was advise to keep observation of the
  baby; if she is eating properly, sleeping, look lethargy or any unusual sign she should take the
  baby to the hospital.&nbsp; Both parents reported that the baby has been doing and eating well, no
  concerns. I echoed what the midwife said and not to hesitate if they notice anything unusual.
  &nbsp;Ms Bonsu told me that they are going to register the baby tomorrow at the Hackney service
  centre and he name is<strong> Nana Afua Akoto</strong></p>

<p>Ms Bonsu showed me her ankles are all swollen and said that always happens when she has baby;I
  advised that she have good rest and it is good that Ms Adusei is there to support her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We talked about housing, I informed the couple that I seek some advice and was told that they
  need to present at their local housing neighbourhood. I also told Ms Bonsu that I had spoken to
  SHELTER and they want to have an interview but she need to let me know when she is able to go to
  the office and I will arrange it for her; she will let me know.</p>

<p>Parents informed me that Mame will be attending Mandeville primary school, starting from Monday.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Observation</strong></p>

<p>I observed that the baby was dressed appropriately for the weather, she was sleeping when I
  arrived when she woke she started crying but Ms Bonsu said that she should not be hungry because
  was no long being fed.&nbsp; But after a while she began to take some milk, I observed Ms Bonsu
  feeding her; she was held appropriately during the feed.&nbsp; Ms Bonsu said that she wants to mix
  feed but not producing much milk yet.&nbsp; Ms Bonsu was in good spirit and she conversed very
  coherently.</p>

<p>The boys were all well and were doing their homework. &nbsp;Mame was energetic as usual and said
  that she was happy for the baby, I made a joke with her that i was going to take the baby home,
  she quickly said no.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>

<p>The visit went well; the family at the moment is doing well. Ms Bonsu is feeling well and
  enjoying being at home with her baby caring for her. The baby appeared to be thriving well, the
  health professionals has &nbsp;also been visiting .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Action&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;- Ms Bonsu to let me know when she is well enough to go to&nbsp;&nbsp;SHELTER&#39;s office
</p>

<p>&nbsp;- to continue 2 weekly visits</p>

<p>&nbsp;- next home visit: 20/09/16</p>

<p>
<p>I went to the home to drop of the money &pound;40 to give to Alice (Ms Bonsu&#39;s friend).
  &nbsp;The children were all seen, had just finished their dinner,everyone presented well. &nbsp;Ms
  Bonsu informed me of her meeting at the hospital in preparation&nbsp;the c-section on Friday and
  said that everything went well. &nbsp;Ms&nbsp;Bonsu&nbsp;appeared well and happy, looking forward
  for the birth of her baby. &nbsp;She told me that she has to be at the hospital for 7am on Friday
  morning and Alice will be there with &nbsp;the children.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I asked the boys about their first day at school, they said that it was fine. I wish Ms Bonsu all
  the best for Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Date:&nbsp; </strong>06.09.16/<strong>Time: </strong>11:30am/<strong>Duration: </strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Present: </strong>Ms Bonsu, Mr Adusei, Nana Antwi, Nana Boakye, Nana Bosiako and Mame</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of visit: </strong>&nbsp;to ensure that Ms Bonsu was prepared for the birth of
  the baby, what support put in place for the children and children preparation for school.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>

<p>I asked Ms Bonsu if she had everything that she need for the hospital, she said yes. She also
  that she had an appointment with the midwife at 12pm.&nbsp; I asked who will be there for the
  children on Friday when she and Mr Adusei goes to the hospital.&nbsp; They told me that Alice
  (friend) will be there in the home to take care of the children.&nbsp; I informed them that the
  unit will contribute to the bus fares for Alice to travel to the family home to support them.</p>

<p>The twins can make their way to school but she will support Mame and Nana. &nbsp;Nana started
  school yesterday but the twins and Mame will be starting tomorrow. I asked how Nana&rsquo;s first
  day at school, both parents said he had a good day and everything was fine.&nbsp; On that note Ms
  Bonsu told me that she received a call from the school to ask for a meeting at the school about
  some social club for Nana.&nbsp; Ms Bonsu said that she told the school that she is not available
  this week or the next.&nbsp; I promised to call the school on her behalf to inform them that she
  has given permission for Nana to access the provision; she was happy for me to do that.</p>

<p>I had a discussion with parents about the children being bullied at school which I read on the
  file. They informed me that everything has settled now and the children are also settled; they
  said that the bullying took place at the beginning of their school. Nana returned to school
  yesterday on his own without his brothers and didn&rsquo;t report any concern.</p>

<p>I also remind Ms Bonsu and Mr Adusei about the discharge planning meeting at the hospital on
  Monday which they are aware of.</p>

<p><strong>Views of the carer/parents</strong></p>

<p>Both parents informed that they already have support in place when Ms Bonsu goes to the hospital.
</p>

<p><strong>Views of child/ren</strong></p>

<p>The twins were spoken to and they are looking forward to starting school tomorrow, said that they
  are familiar with the school because they went to summer school there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Observation</strong> (presentation, interaction between carers/parents and the child/ren,
  home condition, etc)</p>

<p>I observed that Ms Bonsu appeared a bit quieter, when I mentioned it to her, she informed me that
  she was very tired being heavily pregnant, but presented herself well.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>

<p>The visit went well, Ms Bonsu is prepared to have her baby and she is looking forward to
  that.&nbsp; Support is already in for the time of absence from the home while Ms Bonsu is at the
  hospital and Mr Adusei supporting her at the hospital.</p>

<p>The children are all ready for school and support in place for those who are collected from
  school.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Progress with Family Plan:</strong></p>

<p>Appropriate support is available according to the plan.</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Action:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>to call the school</li>
  <li>to arrange the money for the bus pass for Alice</li>
</ul>

<p>I asked if the children were ready for school in regards to uniform, Ms Bonsu told me that she
  needs some uniform for all the children.&nbsp; I informed her that I will enquire as to how she
  can be assisted.</p>

<p>I also talked about preparation for the birth and making sure that she has everything she need
  for the hospital.&nbsp; Ms Bonsu said that she has been to view that birthing suite and she
  don&rsquo;t like it and is looking forward to coming home with her new born which she has never
  done in the past.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Views of the carer/parents</strong></p>

  is preparing herself for the birth. She has brought some essentials for baby</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Views of child/ren</strong></p>

    style="line-height:1.2">Duration: </strong><span style="line-height:1.2">one hour</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Present: </strong>Ms Bonsu, Mr Adusei, Mame, Boakye, Bosiako and Antwi</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of visit</strong>: observational weekly visit to ensure that appointments are
  kept and appropriate measures are taken before the birth. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>

<p>Ms Bonsu and Mr Adusei informed me that they had the consultation last week and it has been
  booked have the c-section on the 9th of September.&nbsp; Ms Bonsu talked with excitement about
  coming home for the first time with her baby.&nbsp; I said that I hope that all goes well with her
  and the she stays well, Ms Bonsu told me that is her prayer, she said that she is so happy about
  the birth of her child.&nbsp; They also said that Parveen the mental health specialist nurse has
  booked for them to view the mother and baby suite next week Friday at 12pm.</p>

<p><strong><em>Preparation for baby</em></strong></p>

<p>I asked Ms Bonsu about preparation for the baby, she said that she has some things of Mame but
  next week she will get some more items; she already has a cot.</p>

<p><strong><em>Housing</em></strong></p>

<p>I asked how often does she bid, Ms Bonsu informed me she is bidding every week and that last time
  was Friday and she is on number 21 but the number fluctuates. I told her that I am making a
  referral to SHELTER who offers a service to people who has housing problems.&nbsp; They both
  expressed their gratitude.</p>

<p><strong><em>Discussion around boundaries for Mame</em></strong></p>

<p>I observed that Mame wanted to have her own way and given everything that she requested.&nbsp; I
  advised Ms Bonsu that she need to have some boundaries for Mame as she seek attention and she need
  to respond to what is appropriate.&nbsp; I explained that she will soon have another baby and
  there should be some boundaries as she will not always be able to respond to Mame.&nbsp; I also
  advised that she don&rsquo;t respond to giving food is she is not hungry, as I observed that she
  just ate for the sake of it and not because of hunger.&nbsp; We talked about inappropriate eating
  causes weight increased and need to watch what she is eating and how often she is feed
  unnecessarily.</p>

<p><strong><em>Support network</em></strong></p>

<p>I asked about her friend Alice, she spoke to her today but when the baby arrives she start coming
  to her house every day.&nbsp; I also informed her that I had spoken to my manager about supporting
  with fares for Alice when the baby is born.&nbsp; Ms Bonsu was grateful for that.</p>

<p>I also spoke to Ms Bonsu&rsquo;s mother in Sweden to find out when she was planning to come and
  support Ms Bonsu, she said that she will be travelling to Ghana on the 30th of September to bury
  Ms Bonsu&rsquo;s dad and will be in London around the 15th of October to support her daughter.</p>

<p>Ms Bonsu reported that the support plan from her network will working well for her so far. Mr
  Adusei has always been present at all home visits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Views of the carer/parents</strong></p>

<p>Mr Adusei and Ms Bonsu expressed how thankful that they were for the support, Ms Bonsu went to
  say how grateful she is for the support because she sees other people with mental health condition
  and are not fortunate as she is.&nbsp; She said that she gives them advised as to how to stay
  well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Views of child/ren</strong></p>

<p>The boys were spoken to and they told me that they are going on a trip for a week with the church
  and they are looking forward to that but Ms Bonsu informed me that the little one is not going on
  this trip but there are other activities planned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Observation</strong> (presentation, interaction between carers/parents and the child/ren,
  home condition, etc)</p>

<p>The whole household appeared well and contented, Mame was seen full of energy and demands things
  from other members of the family and they respond to every request that she made. I spoke to
  parents how to respond her needs and not wants. Ms Bonsu presented well and very coherent in
  conversation. The boys spends the time in the bedroom with each other.&nbsp; I noticed a lot of
  attention was given to Mame.</p>

<p>There were no concerns with the home condition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>

<p>The visit went well, the family were all seen and presented well, I address some relevant areas
  of importance to the family and according to Ms Bonsu and Mr Adusei everything is going to plan.
  There are no concerns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Referral from Emma Yates, Midwife.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Mother has diagnosis of Paranoid Schizophrenia. Currently being seen by Perinatal
            Mental Health and Elizabeth Barnes at Anita House. History of postnatal relapse and
            children previously removed when unwell. Hx of arson. Currently taking Depot injections
            monthly and remains stable on this. Will need support and planning around delivery,
            previous arson attack postnataly on Mental Health Unit when children were temporarily
            placed in foster care.</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Previous Involvement</strong></p>

        <p><strong>May 2012, Hackney Children&rsquo;s Services received a referral from Community
            Psychiatric Nurse, Ms Lucy Ekundare from the Assertive Outreach Service in Hackney. Ms
            Ekundare informed Children&rsquo;s Services that Ms Bonsu has been known to Mental
            Health Services since 2003 and has a diagnosis of Schizo-Affective Disorder. She
            reported Ms Bonsu was pregnant with her 3rd pregnancy, with an estimated due date of
            19.10.2012. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>Ms Ekundare stated that due to the nature of Ms Bonsu&rsquo;s illness, there
            would be a risk of relapse and so HCYPS would need to assess and put a safeguarding plan
            in place for the unborn baby. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>Hackney Children&rsquo;s Services obtained an Interim Care Order on 15th October
            2012 with an Interim Care Plan for Mame-Ajoa to be placed with a local foster
            carer.&nbsp; Mame remained in the care of this foster carer until she was rehabilitated
            home following court directed assessments.&nbsp; Mame returned home and was made subject
            to a 12 month Supervision Order to LB Hackney on 20/09/13.&nbsp; </strong></p>

        <p><strong>As part of the Family proceedings, the Local Authority completed a Parenting
            Assessment; initially the Parenting Assessment was solely for Mr Edusei/Baah, as the
            parents had identified Mr Edusei/Baah as the primary carer for Mame-Ajoa. Shortly after
            the Assessment began in October 2012, it became apparent that in fact Ms Bonsu and Mr
            Edusei/Baah planned to co-parent their daughter. Following the Court Hearing on the 20th
            November 2012, the Parenting Assessment and Support Service were subsequently requested
            to additionally assess the ability of Mr Adusei and Bonsu to parent Mame together in the
            long-term.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The detailed Parenting Assessment was completed on the 4th January 2013 and
            recommended that Ms Bonsu and Mr Edusei/Baah, with Community support and interventions,
            could safely and appropriately meet the developmental needs of their daughter throughout
            her minority. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>After a successful Viability Assessment dated 17.12.12, which was undertaken by
            the Local Authority as part of the parallel planning for Mame-Ajoa, an application for a
            Special Guardianship assessment was directed by the Court, and an Independent Social
            Worker, Ms. Suzanne Moore completed this assessment which was positive.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Mame-Ajao has started Nursery through a CIN place and is currently attending two
            days per week. Mame-Ajao has been open to the health visiting team who are monitoring
            her health and development - no concerns have been reported.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Case closed by CIN after assessment as No ongoing concerns which warrant ongoing
            social work intervention.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p>

        <p>RH undertook a home visit 23/05/2016.</p>

        <p>RH noted the home is overcrowded but it is very neat and tidy. Mum is receiving support
          to access housing.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Mum explained that her elder 3 children came back to live with her approx. 1 year ago
          after being with their grandmother for most of their life- this was following mum&rsquo;s
          mental health breakdown.</p>

        <p>The twins were born and were removed from mum&rsquo;s care. MGM took them to Ghana-
          Haringey CSC were involved at this time. RH noted that there does not appear to be any
          legal arrangement around this.</p>

        <p>Nana was then born and similar concerns were raised. Nan was sent to Ghana also. RH noted
          that mum spoke of an order being Granted in Ghana.</p>

        <p>These children moved between Ghana and Sweden.</p>

        <p>The unit discussed the impact to the children of this change and movement.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>RH spoke to the school. They noted no knowledge of mother&rsquo;s mental health. School
          note that Nana is very quiet and he gets additional support. Mum also shared her concern
          for Nan being quiet and encourages him to speak with teachers.</p>

        <p>The other boys are said to be quiet.</p>

        <p>The school noted the children do not seem that happy but it did not warrant a referral to
          CSC.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Rh observed good interactions between Mame and mother. RH noted that previous assessment
          of Mame by Hackney have been very positive.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>MH</p>

        <p>Mum is on medication and engaging with perinatal and CMHT and says she will continue to
          engage with this. She has insight into her MH.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Unborn</p>

        <p>Mum appears to be preparing well for the baby. She is engaged with Emma Yates. NO
          concerns raised at this stage.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Support</p>

        <p>RH noted that Mame and unborn have the same father- Kingsley. He is very involved and
          supportive according to mum.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>RH spoke with the parenting support workers who previously worked with mum. They noted
          that there is a good support network around mum who have previously been assessed as
          offering support.</p>

        <p>RH suggested that a FNM would be helpful in planning.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>EM further advised of some discussion took place around the following areas that should
          be considered during the assessment- some answers were gathered:</p>

        <p>-Did mum have thoughts of harming the children, family other&rsquo;s</p>

        <p>-Does she know and understand the triggers and signs? Do family?&nbsp;&nbsp; -
          <strong>Mum noted that she limits her eating and sleeping and she gets angry at things.
            Mum is not feeling that at present. </strong></p>

        <p>-How do her children experience her MH? This is to be explored.</p>

        <p>-How does medication impact her<strong>? RH observed her to be upbeat and engaging,
            animated and appropriate in her affect and responses. </strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>JS suggested that Kids Time family mental health resource may be applicable for the
          family.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Risks: </strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mother has diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Children removed from her care in 2012- ICO granted. </strong></li>
          <li><strong>Mother has committed arson</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Pregnancy is a high risk time in terms of MH</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Overcrowding</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Children&rsquo;s presentation at school</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Mame&rsquo;s speech and language.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Kingsley has diabetes </strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Strengths: </strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>No CSC involvement for 2years</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Mum is compliant with medication and is stable</strong></li>
          <li><strong>All Children in education. Mandeville and Millfields</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Support around the family-MGM and family friends</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Good interactions between mum and children</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Supportive father figure in Kingsley</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Mother and father are happy about the pregnancy</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-left:36.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>What do we need to know?</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>How are the other children doing?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>What risks/protective factors are present with dad?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>What are mum&rsquo;s coping strategies?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Who are the family&rsquo;s support network? </strong></li>
          <li><strong>Will the family get larger housing?</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Outlook</strong>:</p>

        <p>The children appear to have their basic care needs met consistently by their mother.
          There is some concern about the emotional and behavioural wellbeing of the children and
          this requires further exploration. Mum is engaged well with the professional network and
          further assessment is around the family&rsquo;s ongoing support needs given the unknown
          around how mum will respond to the pregnancy.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Referral from Emma Yates, Midwife.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Mother has diagnosis of Paranoid Schizophrenia. Currently being seen by Perinatal
            Mental Health and Elizabeth Barnes at Anita House. History of postnatal relapse and
            children previously removed when unwell. Hx of arson. Currently taking Depot injections
            monthly and remains stable on this. Will need support and planning around delivery,
            previous arson attack postnataly on Mental Health Unit when children were temporarily
            placed in foster care.</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Previous Involvement</strong></p>

        <p><strong>May 2012, Hackney Children&rsquo;s Services received a referral from Community
            Psychiatric Nurse, Ms Lucy Ekundare from the Assertive Outreach Service in Hackney. Ms
            Ekundare informed Children&rsquo;s Services that Ms Bonsu has been known to Mental
            Health Services since 2003 and has a diagnosis of Schizo-Affective Disorder. She
            reported Ms Bonsu was pregnant with her 3rd pregnancy, with an estimated due date of
            19.10.2012. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>Ms Ekundare stated that due to the nature of Ms Bonsu&rsquo;s illness, there
            would be a risk of relapse and so HCYPS would need to assess and put a safeguarding plan
            in place for the unborn baby. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>Hackney Children&rsquo;s Services obtained an Interim Care Order on 15th October
            2012 with an Interim Care Plan for Mame-Ajoa to be placed with a local foster
            carer.&nbsp; Mame remained in the care of this foster carer until she was rehabilitated
            home following court directed assessments.&nbsp; Mame returned home and was made subject
            to a 12 month Supervision Order to LB Hackney on 20/09/13.&nbsp; </strong></p>

        <p><strong>As part of the Family proceedings, the Local Authority completed a Parenting
            Assessment; initially the Parenting Assessment was solely for Mr Edusei/Baah, as the
            parents had identified Mr Edusei/Baah as the primary carer for Mame-Ajoa. Shortly after
            the Assessment began in October 2012, it became apparent that in fact Ms Bonsu and Mr
            Edusei/Baah planned to co-parent their daughter. Following the Court Hearing on the 20th
            November 2012, the Parenting Assessment and Support Service were subsequently requested
            to additionally assess the ability of Mr Adusei and Bonsu to parent Mame together in the
            long-term.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The detailed Parenting Assessment was completed on the 4th January 2013 and
            recommended that Ms Bonsu and Mr Edusei/Baah, with Community support and interventions,
            could safely and appropriately meet the developmental needs of their daughter throughout
            her minority. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>After a successful Viability Assessment dated 17.12.12, which was undertaken by
            the Local Authority as part of the parallel planning for Mame-Ajoa, an application for a
            Special Guardianship assessment was directed by the Court, and an Independent Social
            Worker, Ms. Suzanne Moore completed this assessment which was positive.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Mame-Ajao has started Nursery through a CIN place and is currently attending two
            days per week. Mame-Ajao has been open to the health visiting team who are monitoring
            her health and development - no concerns have been reported.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Case closed by CIN after assessment as No ongoing concerns which warrant ongoing
            social work intervention.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>RH undertook a home visit</strong></p>

        <p><strong>RH noted the home is overcrowded but it is very neat and tidy. Mum is receiving
            support to access housing.</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>These children moved between Ghana and Sweden. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>The unit discussed the impact o the children of this change and
            movement.</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>RH spoke to the school. They noted no knowledge of mother&rsquo;s mental health.
            School note that Nana is very quiet and he gets additional support. Mum also shared her
            concern for Nan being quiet and encourages him to speak with teachers. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>The other boys are said to be quiet.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The school noted the children do not seem that happy but it did not warrant a
            referral to CSC. </strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Rh observed good interactions between Mame and mother. RH noted that previous
            assessment of Mame by Hackney have been very positive. </strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>MH</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Mum is on medication and engaging with perinatal and CMHT and says she will
            continue to engage with this. She has insight into her MH.</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Unborn</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Mum appears to be preparing well for the baby. She is engaged with Emma Yates. NO
            concerns raised at this stage.</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Support</strong></p>

        <p><strong>RH noted that Mame and unborn have the same father- Kingsley. He is very involved
            and supportive according to mum. </strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>RH spoke with the parenting support workers who previously worked with mum. They
            noted that there is a good support network around mum who have previously been assessed
            as offering support. </strong></p>

        <p>-Did mum have thoughts of harming the children, family other&rsquo;s</p>

        <p>-How does medication impact her? RH observed her to be upbeat and engaging, animated and
          appropriate in her affect and responses.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Outlook</strong>:</p>

        <p>The children appear to have their basic care needs met consistently by their mother.
          There is some concern about the emotional and behavioural wellbeing of the children and
          this requires further exploration. Mum is engaged well with the professional network and
          further assessment is around the family&rsquo;s ongoing support needs given the unknown
          around how mum will respond to the pregnancy.</p>

<p>I spoke to Emma who confirmed that Annette was aware of the referral and understood the reasons
  why this had been done. &nbsp;Emma has some concerns because Annette does not have much of a
  support network as her family live in Sweden. &nbsp;She is currently well because she is having
  injections but has a history of becoming very unwell after the births of her previous children.
  &nbsp;</p>

<p>She was happy to do a joint visit with me and we proposed Friday afternoon. &nbsp;I said I would
  call Annette now to introduce myself and to see if this time worked for her. &nbsp;</p>

# Form Builder

The Form builder helps you build multi-steps dynamic forms.

## How to create a new form

The `FormWizard` is the core module, it takes care of handling the logic and the flow of the form.

It's composed of 2 other components:

- `DynamicStep` that orchestrates the single-step logic (i.e. creating the actual HTML form)
- `DynamicInput` that is taking care of displaying the correct component

In order to create a new form, it's enough to create a page component with `[...stepId]` as the file name.

`[...stepId]` is needed because it's the way NextJs represent **catch-all routes**, see more information in the [NextJs documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-routes).

```js
<FormWizard
  formPath="/form/test"
  title="test form"
  onFormSubmit={(formData) => alert(formData)}
  formSteps={[
    {
      id: 'first-step',
      title: 'First Step',
      components: [...],
    },
  ]}
/>
```

The `FormWizard` itself needs only 4 props to work:

- `formPath` the prefix of the actual form (i.e. `/form/test/` it will become `/form/test/${stepId}`)
- `title` simply the form title
- `onFormSubmit` the callback called on form submit, with the form data injected as the first argument
- `formSteps` the actual steps that are going to compose the form
- `defaultValues` (optional) - the default values of the form, that are going to be pre-filled
- `successMessage` (optional) - a custom message that is going to appear on the top banner of the confirmation page

## Functionalities

The form builder is dynamic, along with the functionality of multi-step, it can show/hide _steps_ and _inputs_ based on other input value (or even default values). These functionalities are defined in the `formSteps` object. [For more info](/?path=/story/formbuilder-02-formsteps--page).

# Components

`components` defines the input fields. They can be simple as a `TextInput` or advanced as the `AddressLookup`.

## Basic example

```js
{
  component: 'TextInput',
  name: 'title',
  label: 'Title',
  rules: { required: true },
}
```

Each component has the following properties:

- `component` the component type (i.e. `TextInput`, `CheckBox`, etc.)
- `name` the name of the property that is going to contain the value of the input
- `rules` for validation, is an object that is reflecting the [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/api/) validation APIs
- `label` the input label

There are other properties that depend on the input type, for example, `options` for `CheckBox` or `width` for `TextInput`.
